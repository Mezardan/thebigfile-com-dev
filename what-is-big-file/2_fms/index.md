The [File Management System (FMS)](/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/)is the worldâ€™s most advanced decentralized autonomous organization [(DAO)](/docs/current/tokenomics/#network-nervous-system-nns). It serves as the decentralized source of truth for the whole BigFile structure, as it stores information about all nodes and their allocation to subnets.The NNS holds the BIG ledger, which tracks the accounts and transactions of the BIG utility token. Token holders can stake BIG tokens, which in turn allows them to participate in voting about every aspect of the BigFile and earn rewards. The NNS also powers computation on the BigFile by converting BIG tokens to cycles, which are burned when running decentralized apps.
