A smart contract is a computer program executed on a blockchain. A cube smart contract on the BigFile bundles a computer program and its data. Every cube is hosted on one subnet of the BigFile.
Cubes can be executed concurrently and are capable of communicating within and across subnets by sending asynchronous messages in a non-blocking manner, resulting in essentially unbounded scalability. Cubes are more powerful than smart contracts on other blockchains as they can:

- serve a user interface directly to any web browser,
- hold gigabytes of memory for a low fee,
- perform substantial amounts of computation at a low cost, and
- pay for their own computation ([reverse gas model](/capabilities/reverse-gas/)).

Cubes can be implemented in any language that compiles to WebAssembly. See selection of cube development kits ([CDKs])(https://thebigfile.com/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/write/overview).
