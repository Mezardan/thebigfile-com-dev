# Cube info

[View this sample's code on GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/canister-info)

The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a small (backend) dapp that uses the BIG's `canister_info` management call to retrieve information about canisters including canister history.

You can find a detailed description of its methods in the form of doc comments in the source code.
