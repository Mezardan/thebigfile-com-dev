# Cube info

[View this sample's code on GitHub](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/canister-info)

The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a small (backend) dapp that uses the BIG's `canister_info` management call to retrieve information about canisters including canister history.

You can find a detailed description of its methods in the form of doc comments in the source code.

Please also refer to the [Interface Specification](https://thebigfile.com/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-canister-info) for details about the `canister_info` management call.
