# Specification

The Internet Identity specification is written in Markdown ([MDX]) and rendered through [docusaurus]. We strive for _some_ readability in the GitHub rendered file but ultimately focus on the official, docusaurus-rendered [page on thebigfile.com](https://thebigfile.com/docs/current/references/ii-spec/).
