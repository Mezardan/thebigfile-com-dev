# Boundary nodes

Boundary nodes serve as the gateway to BigFile, enabling seamless access to cube smart contracts through standard web browsers. They provide an HTTP endpoint and translate all incoming user requests into API cube calls, which are then processed on-chain. Additionally, boundary nodes act as a cache to enhance the performance of dapps hosted on BigFile.
