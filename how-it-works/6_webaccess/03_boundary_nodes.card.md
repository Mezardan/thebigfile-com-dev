# Boundary nodes

The boundary nodes are the gateway to the BigFile and enable seamless access to the cube smart contracts with stock browsers. They provide an HTTP endpoint and translate all incoming user requests to API cube calls, which are processed on-chain. In addition, the boundary nodes act as a cache to improve the performance of the dapps hosted on the BigFile.
