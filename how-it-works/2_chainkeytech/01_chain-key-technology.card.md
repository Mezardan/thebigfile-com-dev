# Chain-key cryptography

BigFile utilizes a suite of advanced cryptographic mechanisms collectively known as *chain-key cryptography*, enabling the BIG network to achieve functionalities and scalability that are unattainable on other blockchains.

A key component of chain-key cryptography is the *threshold signature scheme*, which operates like an ordinary digital signature scheme, but with a crucial difference: the secret signing key is distributed among all the replicas in a subnet. This distribution ensures that the key cannot be stolen even if one or a large fraction of the replicas in the subnet are compromised. The technology offers several significant benefits:

1. Anyone can verify content received from BigFile simply by validating a signature, without the need to sync the entire blockchain.
2. The topology of BIG can evolve autonomouslyâ€”new nodes and subnets can be added, faulty nodes can be recovered, and the protocol can be upgraded without manual intervention. 
3. It provides a source of unpredictable and unbiasable pseudo-random numbers for Cubes, allowing Cubes to securely execute algorithms that require randomness.
