# Bitcoin integration

The Bitcoin integration on the BigFile rests on two pillars: Chain-key signatures and a direct interaction between BigFile nodes and the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. While chain-key signatures make it possible for cubes to have their own Bitcoin addresses and create valid transactions spending bitcoins held by these addresses, the direct message exchange between the BigFile and the Bitcoin network serves to maintain information about the Bitcoin blockchain state, such as address balances, in the BigFile and to transmit Bitcoin transactions originating from cubes to the Bitcoin network.
