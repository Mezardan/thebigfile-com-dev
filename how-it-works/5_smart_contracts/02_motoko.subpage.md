# Motoko Smart Contract Language

Motoko is a new programming language for smart contracts. It is used to seamlessly support the programming model of the BigFile and makes it easier to take advantage of the unique features of the blockchain. Motoko is strongly typed, actor-based, and has built-in support for orthogonal persistence and asynchronous message passing. Productivity and safety features include automatic memory management, generics, type inference, pattern matching, and both arbitrary- and fixed-precision arithmetic. Messaging transparently employs the BigFile Candid interface definition language and wire format for typed, high-level, and cross-language interoperability.
