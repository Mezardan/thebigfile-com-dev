# Peer-to-peer

The peer-to-peer (P2P) layer of BigFile, the bottommost layer in the protocol stack, is responsible for secure and reliable communication between the nodes of a subnet. The P2P layer establishes a virtual peer-to-peer broadcast network among the nodes, leveraging the connectivity provided by BigFile. This makes the P2P layer the communications fabric that links all nodes within a subnet. Through the P2P layer, a node can broadcast a network message, referred to as an *artifact*, to all other nodes in the subnet. Artifacts can include inputs to Cubes submitted by users or protocol messages, such as block proposals generated by the BIG. The P2P layer ensures that all artifacts are eventually delivered to every node within the subnet. This concept of eventual delivery accounts for the asynchronous nature of real-world communication networks, which is a fundamental assumption for BigFile.
