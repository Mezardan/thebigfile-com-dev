# Gateways

BigFile Gateways allow users to seamlessly access content stored on the BigFile network by using their regular web browsers. By pointing to a transaction ID, users can view or render content locally, such as displaying an image or rendering a full HTML web page as a dynamic site.

Beyond serving static web content, gateways empower users to host fully functional, decentralized web applications on the persistent web. This is achieved by indexing transactions and their tags into a queryable database. With built-in support for JavaScript and GraphQL, applications hosted on BigFile can query the network directly, unlocking advanced interactivity and real-time functionality.

Most gateways in the BigFile network provide a GraphQL interface, enabling developers to query tags associated with BigFile transactions efficiently. These tags, which can hold arbitrary data, make it easy to build fully decentralized and dynamic applications. Developers can store user-generated content in BigFile transactions and retrieve it seamlessly when needed.

For instance, a blogging app can tag transactions with App-Name: blog and Type: post, ensuring that blog posts are retrieved automatically when users access the appâ€™s homepage. This system simplifies application development, enhances data accessibility, and supports the creation of dynamic decentralized platforms.
