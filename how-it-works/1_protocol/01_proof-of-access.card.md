# Proof-of-Access

Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA) is a consensus mechanism used to confirm transactions and validate blocks on the BigFile decentralized network. Instead of relying on energy-intensive computational work like Bitcoin does with Proof of Work, BigFile uses SPoRA to verify blocks and confirm transactions in a more efficient manner.

SPoRA allows miners on the BigFile network to prove they have access to random historical data. This eliminates the need for repetitively solving cryptographic puzzles in order to add new blocks to the chain.

Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA) is a consensus mechanism used to confirm transactions and validate blocks on the Arweave decentralized network.
