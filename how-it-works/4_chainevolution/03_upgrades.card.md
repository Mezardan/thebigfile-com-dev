# Protocol upgrade

The BigFile blockchain is governed by the Network Nervous System (NNS), an algorithmic governance system. One of the NNS's many responsibilities is to orchestrate upgrades to the BigFile protocol when the community adopts an upgrade proposal. Upgrading any blockchain presents several challenging problems inherent to decentralized systems, including how to allow arbitrary changes to the protocol, preserve the state of all cube smart contracts, minimize downtime, and roll out upgrades autonomously.
