# Infinite scalability

The BigFile scales its capacity horizontally by creating new subnets that host additional cubes â€” just like traditional cloud infrastructure scales by adding new machines. Once the BIG Network Nervous System (NNS) decided to create a new subnet, it selects a group of spare nodes that have joined the BIG but have not yet been allocated to any subnet and creates the initial configuration of the new subnet. The selected group of nodes then begins to form a new subnet blockchain.
