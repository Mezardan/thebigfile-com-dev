# BIG scalability

BigFile scales its capacity horizontally by creating new subnets to host additional cubes, much like traditional cloud infrastructure scales by adding new machines. When the BIG Network Nervous System (NNS) decides to create a new subnet, it selects a group of spare nodes that have joined BIG but have not yet been allocated to any subnet. These selected nodes are then used to form the initial configuration of the new subnet. The group of nodes subsequently begins forming the new subnet blockchain.
