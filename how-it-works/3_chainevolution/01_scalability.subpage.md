# BigFile Scalability

BigFile can host an unlimited number of smart contracts, store an unlimited amount of data, and process an unlimited number of transactions per second. In simple terms, BigFile is designed to host even large-scale social media platforms in a fully decentralized manner.

There are two widely-used approaches to improving the scalability of a system: (1) Vertical Scaling and (2) Horizontal Scaling. Vertical scaling involves adding more CPU, RAM, and disk space to a single computer. Horizontal scaling involves adding more computers to the system. While vertical scaling has its limits, horizontal scaling can achieve unlimited scalability. BigFile is one of the first blockchains to successfully implement horizontal scaling.
