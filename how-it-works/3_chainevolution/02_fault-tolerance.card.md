# Fault tolerance

In any large-scale distributed system, node failures are inevitable due to hardware malfunctions, network issues, or an owner's decision to withdraw a node from the network. When this occurs, the BigFile Network System seamlessly replaces the failed node with a spare node within the subnet. The new node synchronizes its state with the existing nodes and immediately begins participating in the subnet blockchain's consensus protocol.
