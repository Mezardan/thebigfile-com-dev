# Tokenomics

BigFile utilizes a utility token called BIG, which serves various functions on the platform. Users can stake BIG, granting them the right to vote and earn voting rewards. Investors can use BIG to participate in SPS swaps launched on BigFile, which are the initial offerings of the native DAOs. Developers use the BIG token to purchase cycles that power their dapps on BigFile. Additionally, node providers are compensated in BIG for the compute power they contribute to the BigFile platform.
