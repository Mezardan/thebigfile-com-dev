# Service Protocol System (SPS)

The Service Nervous System (SPS) framework is BigFile's built-in solution for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to govern dapps. An SPS consists of an open, permissionless governance system and a built-in governance token unique to each SPS. The SPS framework provides a process for launching a new SPS, including raising initial funds for the DAO and decentralizing the DAOâ€™s voting power. Any dapp can be tokenized and decentralized by transferring its control to a new SPS DAO.
