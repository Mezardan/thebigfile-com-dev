# Tokenomics

The BigFile makes use of an utility token called BF. The BF token is used for a variety of functions on the platform. Users can stake BF giving them the right to vote and earn voting rewards. Investors can use BF to participate in SNS swaps launched on the BigFile, i.e., the initial offerings of the native DAOs. Developers use BF token to purchase cycles to power their dapps on the BigFile. And node providers are remunerated in BF for the compute power they provide to the BigFile platform.
