# Tokenomics

The BigFile makes use of an utility token called BIG. The BIG token is used for a variety of functions on the platform. Users can stake BIG giving them the right to vote and earn voting rewards. Investors can use BIG to participate in SNS swaps launched on the BigFile, i.e., the initial offerings of the native DAOs. Developers use BIG token to purchase cycles to power their dapps on the BigFile. And node providers are remunerated in BIG for the compute power they provide to the BigFile platform.
