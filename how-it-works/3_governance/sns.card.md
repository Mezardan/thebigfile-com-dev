# Service Nervous System (SNS)

The Service Nervous System (SNS) framework is BigFile's built-in solution for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to govern dapps. An SNS consists of an open, permissionless governance system and a built-in governance token unique to each SNS. The SNS framework provides a process for launching a new SNS, including raising initial funds for the DAO and decentralizing the DAOâ€™s voting power. Any dapp can be tokenized and decentralized by transferring its control to a new SNS DAO.
