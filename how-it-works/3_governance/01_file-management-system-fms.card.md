# File Management System

The File Management System (FMS) is the DAO that controls the BigFile blockchain. It is a permissionless, stake-based governance system where anyone can participate by staking BIG utility tokens. Decisions are made by voting on proposals in a liquid democracy, allowing voters to either vote directly or delegate their voting power to others. The FMS governs all aspects of BigFile, including its tokenomics, the rules of FMS governance itself, the topology of the node machines, and the software that runs on these node machines. All decisions are executed fully on-chain, eliminating the need for trusted third parties.
