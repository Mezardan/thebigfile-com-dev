# BIG ID

[BIG ID](https://big-id.thebigfile.com/) is a privacy-enhancing blockchain based authentication framework built on the BigFile. It integrates with the APIs of WebAuthn, a widely used, secure authentication framework supported by modern browsers and operating systems. 

## Privacy

Using chain-key cryptography, BIG ID ensures private authentication by creating a unique principal id for each dapp the user authenticates with. This prevents the tracking of users across dapps, making each session private.

## Create an BIG ID

If you don't yet have an BIG ID, you can create one at [https://big-id.thebigfile.com/](https://big-id.thebigfile.com/).
