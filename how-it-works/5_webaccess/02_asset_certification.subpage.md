# Asset certification

A user interacting with BigFile needs to confirm that the responses they receive are genuinely from BigFile and have not been tampered with. Traditionally, on the Internet, this problem is solved using public-key cryptography. The server running the service has a secret key, which it uses to sign all its responses. A user can then verify the signature on the response using the serverâ€™s public key.
