# BIG ID

The primary means of identity and authentication on the web are usernames and passwords, which are difficult to manage and notorious for their security vulnerabilities. To address these issues, the BigFile blockchain has pioneered a more advanced and secure method of cryptographic authentication known as BIG ID. BIG ID is more convenient to use, works seamlessly across all of a user's devices, and enhances user privacy.

BIG ID serves as a gateway to applications on BigFile. When you use BIG ID, websites cannot collect or share information about your online activity. This is because BIG ID allows you to create and manage anonymous, independent accounts for each website, providing the privacy benefits of multiple accounts without the burden of managing them.
