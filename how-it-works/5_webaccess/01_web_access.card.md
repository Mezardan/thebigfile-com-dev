# Smart Contracts serve the web

BigFile is a blockchain that can host an entire dappâ€”including the frontend, backend, and data. This is a crucial and distinguishing feature, allowing dapps to run 100% on-chain, thereby inheriting the security and decentralization of the blockchain without sacrificing speed or affordability. This capability is made possible because BIG can securely serve HTTP requests.
