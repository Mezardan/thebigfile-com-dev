      "Today, the main means of identity and authentication prevalently used online are usernames and passwords. The Internet Computer blockchain has replaced this model with a more advanced and much more secure method of cryptographic authentication that is more convenient, works across all of a user's devices, and helps to protect user privacy.

      "The Internet Computer blockchain runs on a network of nodes in independent data centers located around the world. In each of its subnet blockchains, the participating nodes must process the same messages in the same order to ensure that they achieve the same state. To this end, the Internet Computer relies on a novel consensus protocol, as described in this presentation.",
