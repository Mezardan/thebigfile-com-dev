Developers sometimes need to use different versions of dfx. They may be upgrading to a new version of dfx, testing
their project with a beta of an upcoming dfx release, or evaluating someone elseâ€™s project that specifies a particular
dfx version.

The dfx version manager (dfxvm) installs and manages dfx versions. This also paves the way to support package manager
installs of dfx in the future.
