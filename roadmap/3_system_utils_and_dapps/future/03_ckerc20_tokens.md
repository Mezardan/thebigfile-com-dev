This feature brings a subset of Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens over to the BIG in the form of chain-key tokens, i.e., twin tokens of the original tokens on the Ethereum network. Particularly the ckERC-20 twins of stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, are of tremendous importance to the BIG due to the potential liquidity they can bring over to the BigFile ecosystem. The initial implementation is done using HTTPS outcalls to multiple Ethereum JSON RPC providers for communication with the Ethereum network. Once available in the future, the full Ethereum integration of the BigFile will be leveraged for communicating with the Ethereum network in a trustless way. Chain-key ECDSA signing (threshold ECDSA) is used for trustlessly creating the required transactions on the Ethereum network.
