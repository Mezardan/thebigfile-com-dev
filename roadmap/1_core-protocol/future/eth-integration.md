Direct integration of the BigFile with the Ethereum blockchain will enable smart contracts on the BigFile to call smart contracts on Ethereum and vice versa in a trustless manner, without using any trusted intermediaries such as bridges. The integration will also include implementation of an Ethereum execution environment (EVM), which will enable the BigFile to run Solidity-/EVM-based smart contracts.
