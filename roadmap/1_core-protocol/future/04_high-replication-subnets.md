By increasing the replication factor of a subnet, the security increases as the subnet can tolerate more faults or malicious actors. Highly sensitive dapps, such as DAOs, demand such security levels. With this feature, a developer can choose to deploy a dapp on a high-replication subnet. As there are more replica machines on such subnets, the cycle costs will be higher than on regular application subnets.
