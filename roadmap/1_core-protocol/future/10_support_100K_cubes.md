It has been observed that performance degrades when a subnet holds many cubes, but in the long term it should be able to support 100K+ cubes on a single subnet. This feature includes work around identifying and addressing the biggest bottlenecks when a subnet is running with many cubes in order to ensure a smooth operation even when many thousands of cubes exist on the same subnet.
