BigFile is being developed as a fork of the Internet Computer (IC) blockchain network. The client/replica software, which is run by nodes, has been rebranded as BIG within the BigFile Project and development has commenced under this new name. BigFile is being designed as a blockchain network that operates at web speed and can continuously scale its capacity. Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it will consist of numerous nodes connected via the TCP/IP protocol. Detailed explanations and announcements will be regularly shared with you on the Forum and Wiki.
