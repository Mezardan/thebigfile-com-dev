BigFile is being developed as a fork of the Arweave blockchain network. The client and replica software, operated by nodes, has been rebranded as 'bigfile' within the BigFile Project, and development is actively underway under this new identity. Designed to operate at web speed, BigFile aims to deliver a blockchain network capable of continuous scalability. Detailed updates, explanations, and announcements will be regularly shared on the Forum and Wiki.
