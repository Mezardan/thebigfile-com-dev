This feature gives node providers decentralized means to specify a deny-list for cubes. As node providers are the first to be contacted if questionable content is being stored in a cube smart contract on BigFile, adding a deny-listing feature will allow them to make independent decisions about blocking such content, while users can choose which boundary node to use.
