This feature improves the user experience by enabling developers to specify caching information (e.g., time-to-live) on their assets (HTML pages, JS sources, images, etc.) and exposing them to the HTTP gateways (e.g., `icx-proxy`` on the boundary nodes). This feature relies on the certified headers.
