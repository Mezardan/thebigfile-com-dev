             Decentralized Data Storage
            </h3>
            <p className="tw-paragraph mb-0">
              Most people rely on cloud storage apps, social media platforms, and personal hard drives to store their digital files, but these options are not built to last. Hard drives fail, social media policies shift unpredictably, and cloud storage demands ongoing subscriptions. BigDrive provides a lasting alternative: pay once, store forever. With BigDrive's decentralized data storage, your files remain secure for generationsâ€”no subscriptions required.

             BigFile is secured by an open, decentralized network of miners who store and replicate data in exchange for BIG token rewards. These rewards are sustainably funded through the BigFile endowment, ensuring your data remains perpetually available, supported by a transparent and immutable risk model.
