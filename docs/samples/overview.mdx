<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Sample projects"]} />

Take a look at some sample dapps below and see the possibilities of building on BIG. All samples and further projects can be found in the [samples repo](https://github.com/thebigfilecom/examples).

## Hello, world!


## Basic decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)

This sample dapp showcases decentralized governance. It demonstrates how to initialize a set of accounts and corresponding tokens, how account owners can submit proposals for other account owners to vote on, and how a proposal is executed given enough favorable votes.
