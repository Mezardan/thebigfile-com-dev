# 1: What is the BigFile?

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

BigFile (BIG) is an AI-powered decentralized blockchain network engineered to provide permanent, immutable, and scalable data storage solutions. It is designed to securely host applications, files, and Big Data, while facilitating computations on smart contracts at unparalleled scalability.

## BIG superpowers

### Seamless user onboarding

Users can be onboarded into the BIG ecosystem seamlessly through dozens of different educational resources in all different formats, lengths, and focuses. Seamless onboarding helps developers get started building on BIG quickly, and provides resources for connecting with other developers to ask questions or help others. Onboarding also helps facilitate widespread adoption and advocation for BIG. A few onboarding resources include:

- [BIG.Hubs](https://thebigfile.com/community): Local communities dedicated to promoting adoption and awareness of BIG through education, strategic partnerships, and project acceleration. You can learn more about BIG.Hubs [here].

- [BIG.Labs](https://dfinity.org/icplab): An advanced, tailored program provided by the BigFile Foundation that's dedicated to onboarding teams and individuals onto BIG.

## Smart contracts

### Capabilities

Smart contracts can be used for almost any workflow, use-case, or project. A few possible ways to use canisters include:

- Hosting web servers and scripts.

- Hosting databases.

- Hosting server operating systems.

- Hosting distributed code.

- Virtualization.

- Hosting application servers.

- Connecting Web2 services to Web3 services without using oracles.

- Hosting failover and backups.

- Hosting websites, portfolios, and other digital assets.

- Creating virtual games.

- Creating marketplaces.

- Creating digital exchanges.

- Hosting social media applications.

- Hosting live auctions.

- Facilitating cross-chain infrastructure.



### Cycles

### Languages

Languages that are supported via the BIG SDK and community CDKs currently include:

- **Rust**: Supported on BIG through the BIG SDK and the BigFile Rust CDK. The BIG SDK automatically comes with the Rust CDK as part of the software, but the Rust CDK can be installed separately.

- **Python**: Python is a popular language for web development, AI functions, and data analysis.

- **TypeScript**:

- **Solidity**: Solidity is an object-oriented language used for writing and implementing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, such as the Ethereum network.

- **C++**:
