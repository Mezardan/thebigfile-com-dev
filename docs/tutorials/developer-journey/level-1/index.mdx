- [1.1 Exploring a live demo](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.1-live-demo): Before you begin developing your own dapps, let's explore a live, deployed cube that utilizes the Motoko playground through the `dfx deploy --playground` command. This module covers:
    - Overview of Motoko Playground.
    - An overview of the `dfx deploy --playground` command.
    - Deploying a cube to Motoko Playground using `dfx`.
    - Interacting with the cube via the CLI.
    - Interacting with the cube via the Candid interface.

- [1.2 Motoko level 1](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.2-motoko-lvl1): To develop your own dapp, you first need to cover the fundamentals of writing Motoko code. This module covers:
    - Basic concepts and terms.
    - Motoko syntax.
    - Using the base library.
    - Declarations and expressions.
    - Defining an actor.
    - Values and evaluation:
        - Primitive values.
        - Non-primitive values.
    - Printing values.
    - Passing text arguments.

- [1.3 Developing your first dapp](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.3-first-dapp): Now you're ready to develop your first dapp on the BigFile! This module covers: 
    - Creating a new project.
    - Reviewing the project's file structure.
    - Writing the backend cube code.
        - Creating an actor.
        - Defining the `getQuestion` method.
        - Query calls vs. update calls.
        - Creating a data structure to store the data.
        - Importing additional dependencies.
        - Declaring the `votes` variable.
        - Declaring the `getVotes` method.
        - Declaring the `votes` method.
        - Declaring the `resetVotes`  method.
        - Final code.
    - Deploying the dapp locally.
    - Adding pre-developed frontend code.
    - Re-deploying the dapp.

- [1.4 Acquiring and using cycles](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.4-using-cycles): To deploy dapps on the mainnet, you'll need to acquire cycles. This module covers: 
    - Overview of cycles.
    - Creating a developer identity.
    - Acquiring cycles using a cycles coupon.
    - Converting BIG tokens to cycles.

- [1.5 Deploying cubes](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.5-deploying-cubes): Once you have acquired some cycles, you can deploy our dapp to the mainnet. This module covers: 
    - Deploying to the mainnet.

- [1.6 Managing cubes](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.6-managing-cubes): Once your dapp is deployed on the mainnet, you need to learn how you can manage the cube. This module covers: 
    - Obtaining a cube's ID.
    - Obtaining cube information.
    - Adding an identity as a controller of a cube.
    - Managing the running state of a cube.
    - Checking the cycles balance of a cube.
    - Topping up a cube.
    - Getting cycles back from a cube.
    - Setting the cube's freezing threshold.
    - Deleting a cube.
