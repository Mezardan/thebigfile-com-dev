# 1.6 Managing cubes

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />


## Overview

Now that you have cubes deployed on the mainnet, the next step is to learn how to manage those cubes. Managing a cube includes workflows such as obtaining information, setting an identity as the cube's owner, and deleting a cube. You'll dive into these different workflows and more in this guide to assure that you have the core fundamentals of how to maintain cubes.

## The BIG management cube

To enable cube management, the the management cube exposes management functionality to end users and other cubes. While it is titled the 'management cube', it is not actually a cube that exists with an isolated state, Wasm code, etc; it is a facade. It is important to understand the management cube's role, however, in order to understand some of the advanced BIG features, such as threshold ECDSA and integrations like Bitcoin.

Management operations such as updating a cube, creating a cube, and stopping or starting a cube, are sent to the management cube and then executed. When executed, the messages are sent to the relevant subnet and intercepted by the execution environment, which triggers the execution of the operation.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, verify that you have set up your developer environment according to the instructions in [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/dev-env).

You will be building off of the previous three modules, [1.3 Developing your first dapp](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.3-first-dapp), [1.4 Acquiring and using cycles](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.4-using-cycles), and [1.5 Deploying cubes](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.5-deploying-cubes). You will need to have followed along and completed the steps outlined in these modules to complete this tutorial.

## Obtaining a cube's ID

Each cube has a unique identifier that can be used to interact with the cube. These unique IDs can be used to access the cube's frontend or Candid UI in a web browser, such as when you accessed the frontend of your poll dapp in the last tutorial. Having a cube's ID is also important for executing management functions of the cube, such as setting ownership for the cube.

As an example, to get the cube ID of your `poll_backend` cube that's been deployed on the mainnet by using the command:

```bash
dfx cube id poll_backend --network ic
```

This command will return the cube's ID, which will look something like this:

```
bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai
```

If you want to get the cube ID for a locally deployed cube, simply omit the `--network ic` flag, such as:

```bash
dfx cube id poll_backend
```

## Obtaining cube information

Next, to obtain some information about your cube, such as the cube's controller(s) and the Wasm module hash, use the command:

```bash
dfx cube info poll_backend
```

The output will be returned, such as:

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Adding an identity as a controller of a cube

To add another identity as an additional controller of the cube, first, let's create a new identity:

```bash
dfx identity new ControllerExample
```

Then, get the principal value for this new identity with the command:

```bash
dfx identity use ControllerExample
dfx identity get-principal
```

The output will resemble the following:

```
lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

Copy this value. You'll then use the `dfx cube update-settings` command to add this principal to be a controller of your `poll_backend` cube, but first, you need to switch back to your previously created identity, since only existing controllers can add new controllers:

```bash
dfx identity use DeveloperJourney
```

Then, use the `dfx cube update-settings` command:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings poll_backend --add-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

For example, to use your principal value from above:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings poll_backend --add-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

This command adds the principal `lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae` as an additional controller of your `poll_backend` cube. To confirm that this principal has been added, you can run the `dfx cube info` command again:

```bash
dfx cube info poll_backend
```

Now you can see this principal listed as a controller:

```
Controllers: bnz7o-iuaaa-aaaaa-qaaaa-cai lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae x4d3z-ufpaj-lpxs4-v7gmt-v56ze-aub3k-bvifl-y4lsq-soafd-d3i4k-fqe
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

You can remove this principal with the command:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings poll_backend --remove-controller PRINCIPAL_ID
```

Alternatively, you can use the `--set-controller` flag instead of the `--add-controller` flag. If any controllers are set using the `--set-controller` flag, any other existing controllers will be removed. For example, re-run the command above, but use the `--set-controller` flag instead:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings poll_backend --set-controller lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
```

You will be warned that you'll be removing yourself as a controller, since you're setting the `ControllerExample` identity as the sole controller, while you're using the `DeveloperJourney` identity. Accept this warning.

Then, rerun the `dfx cube info poll_backend` command. The output should now be:

```
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Managing the running state of a cube

Once a cube has been deployed, it can receive and process requests from other cubes or end-users. When a cube is able to send requests and receive replies, the cube is in a **Running** state.

Cubes are placed in the **Running** state by default, but there may be situations where a cube needs to be temporarily or permanently stopped. For example, before a cube is upgraded it may be stopped to ensure proper message handling if the message is in progress or should be rolled back. Stopping a cube is also a requirement if the cube is going to be deleted.

To check the current state of all cubes, you can use the command:

```bash
dfx cube status --network ic --all
```

Or, you can check the status of a single cube by specifying it's name, such as:

```bash
dfx cube status poll_backend --network ic
```

The output of the command will resemble the following:

```
Cube status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Running
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

Stopping a cube works in a similar fashion. For example, to stop a single cube, run the command:

```bash
dfx cube stop poll_backend --network ic
```

Or, to stop all cubes, use the command:

```bash
dfx cube stop --network ic --all
```

This command displays output similar to the following:

```
Stopping code for cube poll_backend, with cube_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
Stopping code for cube poll_frontend, with cube_id 5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai
```

Then you can verify that the cubes have been stopped by rerunning the `dfx cube status` command:

```bash
dfx cube status --network ic poll_backend
```

Which should return:

```
Cube status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

Then to start the cube again, run the command:

```bash
dfx cube start --network ic --all
```

This will return a confirmation such as:

```
Starting code for cube poll_backend, with cube_id 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai
Starting code for cube poll_frontend, with cube_id 5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai
```

## Checking the cycles balance of a cube

To check a cube's cycles balance, you must be the controller of the cube. The cycles balance can be seen in the output of the `dfx cube status` command, such as:

```bash
dfx cube status 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai --network ic
```

The output will resemble the following, where the value `Balance` refers to the main cycles balance and `Reserved` refers to the reserved cycles balance:

```
Cube status call result for 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 2_592_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 5_000_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```

## Topping up a cube's cycles balance

Depositing cycles into a cube's cycles balance is known as 'topping up' the cube's balance. For production cubes, which are consistently using cycles over time to pay for the cube's resources, topping up the cube is required, routine maintenance.

While you must be a cube's controller in order to view the cycles balance of the cube, anyone can top up a cube.

There are a few ways to top up a cube:

- Using BIG in your account.
- Using the cycles ledger.
- Using the NNS dapp web UI.
- Using a third-party service such as [CycleOps](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles_management_services).

This tutorial will cover the first two workflows. [Learn more about using a third-party service for cycles management](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles_management_services).


## Setting the reserved cycles limit

When a cube allocates storage bytes, the system may reserve some amount of cycles by moving them from the main cycles balance of the cube to the reserved cycles balance.
These reserved cycles are used for [future storage payments](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).

You can control the maximum amount of reserved cycles by setting the reserved cycles limit:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai --reserved-cycles-limit 42 --network ic
dfx cube status 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai --network ic
```

The first command sets the reserved cycles limit to `42` and the second command queries the cube status and shows the following output:

```
Cube status call result for 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai.
...
Reserved: 0 Cycles
Reserved Cycles Limit: 42 Cycles
...

```

Once the reserved cycles balances reaches the reserved cycles limit, the system is going to fail all operations that require cycle reservation.
The error message might look like this:

```
Cube cannot grow memory by 65536 bytes due to its reserved cycles limit. The current limit (42) would be exceeded by 1000.
```

Such errors can be fixed by increasing the reserved cycles limit.


### Using BIG

If you currently have a balance of BIG tokens within your dfx ledger account ID, you can use the `dfx ledger top-up` command to automatically convert that BIG into cycles and deposit it into the specified cube, for example:

```bash
dfx ledger top-up 5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai --amount 2.7 --network ic
```

### Using the cycles ledger

You can top up a cube using the cycles balance associated with your identity and the cycles ledger with the command:

```bash
dfx cycles top-up `AMOUNT` `CUBE_ID` --network ic
```

## Getting cycles back from a cube

To withdraw cycles from a cube, the cube must be deleted. The cycles will be returned to the identity associated with the cube's controller principal.

First, check the cycles balance of your identity:

```
dfx cycles balance
```

This will return your cycles balance, such as:

```
90.700 TC (trillion cycles).
```

Then, you can stop and delete the cube with the commands:

```bash
dfx cube stop jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network ic
dfx cube delete jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai --network ic
```

The output of the `dfx cube delete` command will return information regarding the cycles withdraw:

```
Beginning withdrawal of cycles to cube jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai; on failure try --no-wallet --no-withdrawal.
Setting the controller to identity principal.
Installing temporary wallet in cube poll_backend to enable transfer of cycles.
Attempting to transfer 3089393970000 cycles to cube jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai.
Successfully withdrew 3089393970000 cycles.
Deleting cube poll_backend, with cube_id jqylk-byaaa-aaaal-qbymq-cai
```

To confirm that the cycles were withdrawn properly, check your cycles balance again with `dfx cycles balance`. The balance should be increased, such as:

```
93.789 TC (trillion cycles).
```

## Setting the cube's freezing threshold

In the output of the `dfx cube status` command, you may have noticed the `freezing threshold` value. The freezing threshold is a value defined in seconds, which is used to calculate how many cycles a cube must retain in its cycles balance. This calculation is based off of the cube's memory consumption. The default freezing threshold value is `2_592_000s`, which corresponds to 30 days.

The freezing threshold is important because if a cube runs out of cycles, it will be uninstalled. The freezing threshold protects it from deletion, since if the cycles balance dips below the threshold, the cube will stop processing any new requests; however, it will continue to reply to existing requests.

For example, to set a freezing threshold for your `poll_backend` cube, use the command:

```bash
dfx cube update-settings poll_backend --freezing-threshold 3472000
```

Then, you can confirm that this threshold has been set by running the `dfx cube status poll_backend --network ic ` command again:

```
Cube status call result for poll_backend.
Status: Stopped
Controllers: lalyb-uhvmt-p7ubs-u5t7l-hce6v-lp7c5-dlmj5-wi2gc-depab-wtgi3-pae
Memory allocation: 0
Compute allocation: 0
Freezing threshold: 3_472_000
Memory Size: Nat(2363181)
Balance: 3_100_000_000_000 Cycles
Module hash: 0xf8680eb74022a1079012b7e9c644d1156580002a6126305791811533d3fd6f17
```


## Deleting a cube

The last portion of cube management that will be covered in this guide is deleting cubes. To delete a single cube, first you need to stop the cube with the command:

```bash
dfx cube stop poll_frontend --network ic
```

Then you can run the command:

```bash
dfx cube delete poll_frontend --network ic
```

When a cube is deleted, the cube's code, state, and cube ID are removed. Cubes must be stopped before they can be deleted. Alternatively, all cubes for a project can be deleted with the commands:

```bash
dfx cube stop --network ic  --all
dfx cube delete --network ic  --all
```
