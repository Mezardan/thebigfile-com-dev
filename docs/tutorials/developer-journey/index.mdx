# Welcome to the BIG developer journey

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Are you ready to get started developing on the BigFile, but not sure where to begin? 

The developer journey is designed to give both new and existing developers a clear learning path to develop on the BigFile. Starting at level 0 with an introduction to the BigFile, terminology, and setting up a developer environment, to level 5 that details building complex dapps, the Developer Journey contains essential information for developers of all skill levels.
