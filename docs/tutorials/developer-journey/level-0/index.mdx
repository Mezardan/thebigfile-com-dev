- [0.3 Developer environment setup](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/dev-env): Before you can begin the developer journey, you need to set up the developer environment. A developer environment is comprised of tools and packages that are required to develop code projects. This module covers:
    - Setting up a developer environment:
        - Confirming an internet connection.
        - Confirming access to a CLI.
            - Options for Windows users.
        - Downloading and installing the BIG SDK.
        - Downloading and installing an IDE.
        - Downloading and installing git.
        - Downloading and installing Node.js.
        - Assuring all packages and tools are updated to latest version.

- [0.4 Introduction to cubes](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/intro-cubes): This page introduces cubes, their architecture, and discusses the different types of cubes that can be developed. This module covers:
    - Architecture:
        - Languages.
        - Actors.
        - Why is code compiled into WebAssembly?
    - Types of cubes:
        - Backend cubes.
        - Frontend cubes.
        - Custom cubes.
    - Using a single or multiple cube architecture.
    - Cube communication.
    - Cube controllers.
    - Cycles and resource charges.

- [0.5 Introduction to languages](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/intro-languages): This page discusses the different languages that can be used to develop dapps, and provide a base-level introduction to the two primarily supported languages: Motoko and Rust. This module covers:
    - Motoko.
        - Motoko's attributes.
    - Rust.
        - Rust's attributes.
    - Candid.
    - Community developed CDKs:
        - Python.
        - TypeScript.
        - Solidity.
        - C++.

- [0.6 Introduction to dfx](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-0/intro-dfx): `dfx` is a command-line execution environment for the BIG SDK. It is the primary tool used for creating, managing, and deploying dapps onto the BigFile. This module covers:
    - Basic usage and syntax:
        - Subcommands.
        - Flags.
        - Options.
