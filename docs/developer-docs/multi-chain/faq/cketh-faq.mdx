# ckETH FAQ

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "FAQ"]} />

The following questions and answers are from the POV of a developer.

For questions from the POV of a user who wishes to know how to hold, send, receive these tokens, please see the user FAQs.

## How do I write a smart contract that uses ckETH?

At high-level:

1. ckETH complies with the [ICRC-1 ledger token standard](/docs/current/developer-docs/defi/overview/#icrc-1-ledgers).

2. You can write a smart contract that works with ckETH just like you would for any other `ICRC-1`-compliant token.

3. You can find all the ICRC-1 ledger endpoints [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1/tree/main/standards/ICRC-1).

4. Requests for balances and transfers must be sent to the ckETH ledger, which has the canister ID `ss2fx-dyaaa-aaaar-qacoq-cai`.

For detailed information and potential code examples, check out out the [BIG documentation](https://thebigfile.com/docs), the [DFINITY forum](https://forum.dfinity.org), and the [ckETH minter documentation](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/ethereum/ckETH/minter/README.adoc).

## What is the purpose of ckETH? What specific problem does ckETH aim to solve within the ETH ecosystem?

ckETH, or chain-key Ether, is an BigFile (BIG)-native token that represents Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum. It serves as a digital twin of ETH on the BigFile blockchain. The purpose of ckETH is to address some of the challenges associated with using Ethereum, particularly in terms of usability and transaction costs.

One of the main issues it addresses is the high transaction fees (or "gas fees") on the Ethereum network. By allowing Ethereum holders to interact with ckETH on the BigFile, which has significantly lower gas fees, users can enjoy fast and cheap transactions. They can then convert back to Ethereum whenever they want to transact on the Ethereum network.

Another problem that ckETH aims to solve is the complexity and friction involved in using blockchain systems, particularly for mainstream users who are not familiar with the intricacies of tokens and wallets. The process of acquiring and using ckETH is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, removing many of the barriers that can deter people from engaging with blockchain technology.

Furthermore, ckETH enables direct interaction between BIG canister smart contracts and Ethereum, bypassing potential attack vectors by directly calling Ethereum RPCs through HTTPS outcalls.

In summary, ckETH aims to enhance the usability of the Ethereum ecosystem by providing a more accessible, cost-effective, and secure way for users to engage with blockchain technology.

## How does ckETH relate to ETH? How is ckETH different from a regular ETH transaction? Can I use ckETH just like I would use ETH?

The main difference between a ckETH transaction and a regular ETH transaction lies in the transaction fees and the blockchain they operate on. Regular ETH transactions occur on the Ethereum network and are subject to Ethereum's gas fees, which can be quite high. On the other hand, ckETH transactions occur on the BigFile blockchain, which has significantly lower transaction fees.

Yes, you can use ckETH just like you would use ETH, but within the BigFile ecosystem. You can deposit your ETH to a specific function in the ckETH helper contract on Ethereum, which then triggers the BIG ckETH canister smart contract to mint the same amount of ckETH to the specified BIG principal. This ckETH can then be used natively on the BigFile, and can be converted back to ETH at any time.

However, it's important to note that while ckETH can be used in a similar manner to ETH, the platforms and services that accept ckETH might be different from those that accept ETH, as they are operating on different blockchains.

[Learn more about how ckETH works](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckETH-a-canister-issued-ether-twin-token-on-the-ic/22819).

Please note that the ckETH integration is part of a larger Ethereum integration on BIG. [Learn more about the Ethereum integration on BIG](https://thebigfile.com/ethereum-integration).

Also, remember that the BigFile makes it possible to build almost any online service fully on-chain, in a full stack decentralization model. This is because canister smart contracts can hold up to 400GiB of memory each, and run in parallel with great efficiency. Moreover, they can directly serve interactive web-based user experiences to users by processing HTTP requests, thanks to BIG’s reverse-gas model (canister smart contracts pay for their own execution using “cycles” that they have been charged with). Now they can also be trustlessly combined with DeFi and other functionality [Ethereum hosts in a World Computer paradigm](https://thebigfile.com/multichain).

## How does ckETH ensure the security of the funds it handles?

ckETH ensures the security of the funds it handles in several ways:

1. **No need for bridges**: ckETH uses a feature called HTTPS outcalls that enables BIG canister smart contracts to call API requests directly. This bypasses attack vectors by directly calling Ethereum RPCs, eliminating the need for potentially insecure bridges.

2. **Managing an Ethereum wallet directly in an BIG canister**: BIG canister smart contracts can create and manage an Ethereum wallet address using threshold ECDSA. This means that the BIG ckETH minter canister smart contract can generate an address that holds ETH and signs transactions, adding an extra layer of security.

3. **NNS DAO governance**: The development of ckETH includes measures to guarantee long-term maintenance and provide more security to ETH through NNS DAO governance. This ensures that the management and development of ckETH are in the hands of a decentralized community, reducing the risk of malicious actions by a single party.

4. **Chain-key signatures**: BIG has the ability to sign native transactions on other blockchains without using risky bridges. This feature is used in the operation of ckETH, further enhancing its security.

Remember, while these features enhance the security of ckETH, it's always important to exercise caution and good security practices when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

## Can I trust that my funds are safe when using ckETH?

Yes, you can trust that your funds are safe when using ckETH. BIG offers several features that enhance the security and trustworthiness of its canister smart contracts, such as ckETH.

However, as with any blockchain technology, it's important to do your own research and understand the risks involved.

## Can I build smart contracts that interact with ckETH? What kind of functionalities can these smart contracts provide?

Yes, you can build smart contracts that interact with ckETH on the BigFile. These smart contracts, also known as canisters, can provide a wide range of functionalities. Here are some of the key capabilities:

1. **Minting ckETH**: When you deposit your ETH to the ckETH helper contract on Ethereum, the BIG ckETH canister smart contract will mint the same amount of ckETH to your specified BIG principal or wallet address.

2. **Using ckETH**: Once the ckETH is minted, it can be used natively on the BigFile. This means that your smart contracts can interact with ckETH just like they would with any other token on the BigFile.

3. **Converting ckETH back to ETH**: If you want to convert your ckETH back to ETH, you can do so by requesting the ckETH canister smart contract with the ETH amount and Ethereum address to which you want to send the ETH.

4. **Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts**: BIG canisters can interact with Ethereum smart contracts. This is made possible by the BigFile's ability to make HTTPS outcalls to Ethereum APIs to securely query and send transactions to the Ethereum network.

5. **Managing an Ethereum wallet**: BIG canister smart contracts can create and manage an Ethereum wallet address using threshold ECDSA. This means that your smart contracts can hold ETH and sign transactions.

6. **Processing and storing large volumes of data**: Smart contracts can process and store large volumes of data at a relatively stable cost that is a tiny fraction of that on a traditional blockchain.

7. **Serving web experiences directly to end users**: Smart contracts on BIG can serve web experiences directly to end users, providing end-to-end blockchain security.

8. **Creating and managing other Ethereum asset twins**: In addition to ckETH, you can also create and manage "twins" of other Ethereum assets, such as ckUSDC, ckUSDT, ckUNISWAP, ck1INCH, ckAAVE .

Please note that the BIG ETH integration is still in development, and more functionalities will be added in the future.

## What are the transaction fees associated with ckETH?

The trannsaction fees are 0.000002 ckETH.

## How quickly can transactions be finalized?

BIG is designed to finalize transactions very quickly. Specifically, it can finalize transactions that update canister smart contract state in 1–2 seconds. This is a significant improvement over traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can take much longer to finalize transactions.

In addition, BIG splits canister function execution into two types: "update calls" and "query calls". Update calls take 1–2 seconds to finalize their execution. On the other hand, query calls work differently because any changes they make to state are discarded after they run. This allows query calls to execute in milliseconds.

BIG is capable of processing up to over 30 thousand transactions per second (as of [November 2023](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/Internet_Computer_performance)), executed with an average 1-second finality on dapp subnets and a 2-second finality on the Network Nervous System (NNS) subnet.

## Who controls the development and governance of ckETH?

Like many BIG canisters, the

The development and governance of ckETH, the digital twin of ETH on the BigFile (BIG), is managed by the BIG ecosystem.

Software updates to the ckETH canisters are voted on by the NNS DAO.
