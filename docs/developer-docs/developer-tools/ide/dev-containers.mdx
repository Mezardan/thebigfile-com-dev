# Developer containers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "IDE", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Developer containers are a local development option that uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run local containerized environments.

Dev containers have additional benefits, including:

- **Replicability**: Containers make reproducing builds across teams easy since they contain the entire development environment within a portable format. Team members can interact with the same container without needing to setup their own personal developer environment and reproduce the build themselves.

- **Security**: Containers do not have access to the other files or applications on your system, making project development secure.

## Using developer containers

To use developer containers, you must download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [Dev Containers extension](https://containers.dev/supporting#dev-containers).
