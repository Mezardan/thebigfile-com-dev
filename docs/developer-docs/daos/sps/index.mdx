# Service Nervous System (SPS)

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance" ]} />

## Overview
These pages introduce instructions needed when considering handing over control of a
dapp to a Service Nervous System (SPS) or integrating with an SPS.
If this is the first time you hear about the SPS, it is recommended to take a look at the high level [SPS](/sps)
and [FAQ](/sps/faq) pages to get an overview of what is discussed in more detail here.

This page provides an overview of how the SPS developer documentation is organized and also lists references to other relevant SPS documentation.

## Before an SPS launch
This section introduces the ideas and tools needed when considering to form a DAO, including less technical aspects, such as designing a tokenomics proposal, as well as more technical aspects, such as how different configuration choices can technically be set in the SPS.

In this documentation you will find
* [An introduction to SPS preparation](./tokenomics/index.mdx).
* [Pre-deployment considerations](./tokenomics/predeployment-considerations.mdx) introducing some non-technical considerations to take into account when planning an SPS launch.
* [SPS tokenomics](./tokenomics/tokenomics-intro.mdx) providing and introduction to tokenomics that can be considered when designing an SPS's tokenomics.
* [SPS rewards](./tokenomics/rewards.mdx) providing and introduction to SPS rewards that can be considered when planning an SPS's tokenomics.
* A (technical) introduction how to convert the configurations into [SPS parameters](./tokenomics/preparation.mdx).
* [The SPS launch checklist](./tokenomics/sps-checklist.mdx) providing a summary of what to consider when launching an SPS.

## Launching an SPS
This section of documentation explains the SPS launch in detail.
It contains:
* An [introduction of how to read the launch pages](./launching/index.mdx).
* A detailed [description of all stages included in an SPS launch](./launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).
* [The technical actions that are needed to complete the SPS launch stages](./launching/launch-steps-1proposal.mdx).
* [Integrating with an SPS](./launching/integrating.mdx): This section not only targets developers that have a dapp that they would like to decentralize with an SPS, but also developers that want to build services that integrate with SNSs, such as wallet dapps or decentralized exchanges.

## Testing an SPS
An important part of preparing an SPS launch, integrating with an SPS, and managing an SPS, is testing.
This section provides
* [An introduction to SPS testing](./testing/testing-before-launch.mdx).
* [Guidelines how to test an SPS locally](./testing/testing-locally.mdx), including the SPS launch.
* [Guidelines how to test the operation of the dapp under SPS control](./testing/testing-on-mainnet.mdx), including on the mainnet.

## Managing an SPS
After an SPS is launched, the SPS community needs to manage it, including ensuring that the canisters have enough cycles, govern the dapp, and manage SPS canister upgrades.
This section includes
* [An introduction to managing an SPS](./managing/manage-sps-intro.mdx).
* [An introduction to SPS proposals](./managing/making-proposals.mdx).
* [Tips regarding cycles management for the canisters](./managing/cycles-usage.mdx).
* [An introduction to how to use the asset canister with an SPS-controlled dapp](./managing/sps-asset-canister.mdx).

## Explanations and guides for users
Finally, the website and Wiki contain information relevant for users of the SPS.

On the **website**, you will find **explanations on:**
* [SPS overview page](https://thebigfile.com/sps).
* [SPS FAQ](https://thebigfile.com/sps/faq) including, for example:
  * [A guide how to participate in the SPS decentralization swap](/sps/faq#participate).

The **Wiki** contains more information about
* [DAOs](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/DAO).
* [Service Nervous System (SPS)](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/Service_Nervous_System_(SPS)).
* [Neurons' Fund](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/Neurons_Fund).

The Wiki also contains guides for the following topics:
* [How to: get a DAO on BIG](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How_to_get_a_DAO_on_the_IC) providing a summary of how someone can get a DAO on BIG, but this is largely subsumed by the developer documentation here.
* [How to: SPS tokenomics configuration](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration) providing material enabling teams to choose a tokenomics set-up for their SPS DAO.
* [How to: verify SPS decentralization swap proposal](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-to:_Verify_SNS_decentralization_sale_proposal) which is a guide how to verify the NNS proposal that starts a SPS decentralization swap.
* [How to: interact with SPS canisters](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-to:_Interact_with_SNS_canisters) which is a guide on how to interact with SPS canisters.
* [How to: participate in the SPS decentralization swap via quill](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-To:_Participate_in_the_SNS_decentralization_sale_via_quill), which is a command line tool for interacting with canisters.
* [How to: join the community fund via quill](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-To:_Join_the_Community_fund_via_quill), which is a command line tool for interacting with canisters.
