# Launching an SPS

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

This section describes the SPS launch process in detail.
The launch process only requires one single NNS proposal that will, if adopted, trigger the creation of the SPS canisters as well as starting and finishing the decentralization swap.
The section begins with a detailed description of [each stage of an SPS launch](./launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).
Then, it explains the practical [commands and actions used throughout SPS launch](./launch-steps-1proposal.mdx), such as the tools and commands that are needed to take a project through each stage and launch an SPS for it.
