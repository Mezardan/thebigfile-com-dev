# Preparing an SPS launch

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
Launching an SPS entails many non-technical and technical preparations steps.

[The SPS launch checklist](sps-checklist.mdx) summarizes some of the most important preparation
steps to be considered before handing over a dapp to an SPS.

The subsequent pages provide more details on some of these preparations:
* Before diving into the technical details, you may want to spend some time defining
non-technical goals of the SPS and the dapp that will be controlled by it.
To provide some tips on what considerations you should not forget, a few are listed on
[this page](predeployment-considerations.mdx).

* The SPS parameters allow each SPS to define unique settings for tokenomics and how the
governance should work in detail.
To choose initial parameters, it is advisable to understand how the
[SPS tokenomics](tokenomics-intro.mdx) and the [SPS rewards](rewards.mdx) work.
These pages also include a link to additional [tools](https://wiki.thebigfile.com/wiki/How-To:_SNS_tokenomics_configuration)
that allow you to try out different configurations and assess them.

* In the end, the chosen configurations need to be translated to the parameters and
[given as input to the SPS launch process](preparation.mdx).


In addition, during the preparation phase you might want to prepare the [integration of the SPS
with your dapp](../launching/integrating.mdx).
Moreover, you should [test](../testing/testing-before-launch.mdx) your settings and confirm
that the launched SPS will work successfully with your dapp.
Integration and testing are topics that are not only relevant during the SPS launch but also
later in the SPS lifecycle.
Therefore, these two topics are discussed in separate sections below
(see [SPS integration](../launching/integrating.mdx) and [SPS testing](../testing/testing-before-launch.mdx)).
