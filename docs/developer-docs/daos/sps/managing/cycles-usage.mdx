# SPS cycle management

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
:::caution
An SPS community must ensure that all SPS and dapp canisters
have sufficient cycles by manually sending cycles when necessary to
**each individual SPS canister**.


- **Manually** means that someone has to monitor the cycles of the
   canisters and actively make calls to send additional cycles to them
   when the canisters' cycles balance get low.

- This process has to be repeated for **each individual SPS canister**
and also for **each dapp canister**.



At least the latter is not new to developers who built a dapp on BIG.
Nevertheless, it should be underlined the importance of this in the context
of an SPS: **if the SPS governance or SPS ledger canister run out of cycles
and get deleted, this is of course critical as users lose their
liquid and staked tokens and as the dapp canisters cannot be governed
anymore.**
Also, as the SPS canisters are owned by a community, some
coordination might be needed to ensure that some individuals
feel responsible for these steps.

:::

## Cycles in the archive canisters
The SPS community should be aware of most SPS and associated dapp
canisters are either installed when the SPS is initiated or they are
explicitly added to the SPS by a proposal.
One exception are the **archive canisters** of the ledger canister.
Due to limited storage, the ledger cannot keep all blocks forever and
thus it spawns separate archive canisters to do so.
The ledger spawning a new archive affects the cycles as follows:
The ledger takes a predefined number *X* of cycles from its current
cycle balance and creates the archive with these *X* cycles as the
initial balance. The number *X* is set when the SPS ledger canister is
first initialized.

This specifically means that SPS communities should be aware of the
following:
:::caution
The SPS ledger canister automatically spawns new archive
canisters.
When this happens, the cycles balance of these new canisters has
to be managed. The ledger's cycles balance decreases by a
significant amount if a new archive is spawned.
If an archive canister runs out of cycles,
ledger blocks might be lost.
:::

To help SPS communities manage cycles, the SPS is initiated as follows:
* SPS canisters are started with already a large number of cycles,
  namely 180T
* the SPS ledger is started with 60T (2*30T) cycles such
  that when the first archive is spawn,
  both should have roughly 30T cycles (as have all other SPS
  canisters when they are installed).


## How to observe and manage the canisters' cycles
Next, it is described in more detail how you can monitor and manage the
cycles of the SPS and dapp canisters.

### Step 1: Find all SPS and governed dapp canisters and their cycle balance.
SPS root knows about all these canisters and their cycles.
You can get all the SPS and associated dapp canisters' status,
which includes the cycles, by using the SPS root canister's method
`get_sns_canisters_summary`.
<!-- dfx, dashboard?-->

### Step 2: Send new cycles to a given canister.
If the first step shows that one of SPS or dapp canisters runs
low on cycles, you can top up the canister's cycles.

To do this, you need a wallet with sufficient cycles.
In an SPS, can look for people who donate cycles in this way.
You can find [here](/docs/current/developer-docs/production/topping-up-canister/#option-2-if-you-have-cycles-on-your-cycles-wallet) how to transfer cycles from a wallet to any other canister (which can be a dapp or SPS canister).

Otherwise, you can make a proposal that transfers some BIG
from the SPS treasury to an individual who is trusted to convert these to cycles and make such payments.
You can find [here](./making-proposals.mdx) how to make such a proposal.

## The (possible) future of cycles management
As this page shows, the current management of cycles is
quite some work.
Therefore the community is thinking about some enhancements
might be added in the future. Some examples are:

- **Cube groups**: canister groups would allow to manage
   the cycles for groups of canisters rather than for
   individual canisters. If all SPS and SPS-governed dapp
   canister could be in the same group, this might considerably
   simplify SPS cycles management.

- **SPS enhancements to automate some cycle management**: it is
conceivable that the task of taking BIG from the SPS's treasury,
   converting them to cycles, and sending those cycles to the
   SPS canisters can be automated at least to some extent.
