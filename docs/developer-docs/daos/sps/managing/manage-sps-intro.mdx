# Manage an SPS

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

## Overview
SNSs are protocol-provided DAOs on BIG that are to some extent maintained by the
NNS community, who for example approve new upgrades of SPS canister code.
This eliminates much of the maintenance burden from the SPS communities.
However, there are still some maintenance tasks that have to be performed by an
SPS community, such as deciding and voting on _when_ an SPS should be upgraded
to a new version, adjusting the SPS parameters when needed, and making
sure that the SPS canisters do not run out of cycles.


## SPS community

Once an
[SPS is launched](../testing/testing-before-launch.mdx),
neither the dapp that the SPS controls, nor the SPS canisters
are under the control of a singe entity such as a developer.
This means that the dapp and to the SPS
canisters, as well as which changes can be made to them,
are **controlled by the SPS community**.
Anyone with an SPS neuron can make a proposal to suggest
a change in the dapp or to modify a parameter in the SPS
governance and, if the majority agrees, the proposal is
automatically executed on-chain.
For this reason, the following pages are not only relevant
for developers but for any member of an SPS community
who would like to actively help managing the SPS.

## Managing an SPS

This page introduces a
few aspects that are relevant for **managing** an SPS.

* As every piece of software, after an
SPS is launched is has to be **maintained**.
This includes ensuring that the SPS canisters are
running the latest version and that they have enough
cycles to continue operating.
You can find more information on<!--how SPS canisters can be  upgraded to new versions on this page (./upgradeSNS.md)
and about-->
cycle management [on this page](./cycles-usage.mdx).

It is important to especially emphasize the following:

:::caution
The SPS communities are responsible for individually topping up the cycles of
all SPS canisters as well as all dapp canisters that are controlled by the SPS.
Special care must be taken that cycles are also monitored for canisters that
are automatically created. In particular, this includes the archive canisters
that are automatically spawned by the ledger canister.
**If the archive canisters are not provided with sufficient cycles, the ledger block
history may be lost.**
:::

* While SNSs that are provided as a system function can only be upgraded to canister versions approved by the NNS, each SPS community can configure their SPS according
to their needs. Most chosen configurations can also be adjusted over time,
for example to adopt to new situations or to experiment with
different governance and tokenomic models.
Therefore, managing an SPS also means that the community
should regularly consider and adjust these configurations,
which are defined by the SPS's **nervous system parameters**.


<!--We describe on
this page(./nervous-system-parameters.md)
which parameters can be chosen and how they can be adjusted
by proposal.-->

* An SPS community needs proposals, some of which are specific to a given dapp, to govern the DAO with its properties and the dapp. [This page](./making-proposals.mdx) provides some guidelines
regarding how proposals can be used and how an SPS community can define
their own kinds of proposals.

* A dapp might have an associated The [asset canister](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister) that stores and retrieves static assets from a canister deployed on BIG. Once a dapp is under SPS DAO control, the SPS DAO must also be able to control the associated asset canister. More details on how this works can be found on [this page](./sps-asset-canister.mdx).
