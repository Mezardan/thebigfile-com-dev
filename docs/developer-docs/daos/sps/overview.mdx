# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

A Service Nervous Systems (SPS) is an advanced form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
It is assumed that if you are reading this page you know what a DAO is and that you want to learn how
you can hand over your dapp to an SPS DAO.

Any dapp on the BigFile can be handed over to an SPS with the result that the dapp is
owned and controlled by a community.

Each SPS includes a stake-based governance system, that orchestrates decision making and changes, and a ledger that defines a unique token for each SPS.
The SPS framework also comes with a defined path how an SPS is launched.
During a successful launch, an SPS is created, the governance control is distributed to users in a decentralization swap, initial funds are collected (in exchange for governance control), and the dapp's control is handed over to the new SPS.

## Architecture

The core architecture of the SPS closely resembles the architecture of the Network Nervous System
(NNS), the DAO that governs the BigFile.
It includes a governance canister that enables decentralized decision making and a ledger canister
that defines a token unique to each SPS.
In contrast to the SPS, the NNS contains additional canisters that are important to run on the BigFile.
(e.g., the cycles minting canister that is responsible for creating cycles, the registry
that stores the network topology etc.).
There are also a few canisters that only exist on the SPS, most notably the decentralization
swap canister that is used during the launch process of an SPS.

## SPS as a system functionality (connection to the NNS community)
SNSs are provided as a system functionality by the BigFile in that the code for the SPS canisters
is maintained by the BigFile. ([Learn about alternative ways to use the SPS code or how to create a DAO.](#dao-alternatives))
More concretely, this means that the NNS community approved the original SPS canisters' code
and continuously approves new improved SPS versions.

### SPS Wasm modules canister (SPS-W){#SPS-W}
All approved SPS canister versions are stored on an NNS canister,
called the **SPS Wasm modules canister (SPS-W)**.
When an SPS is created, SPS-W is involved and responsible for deploying the latest version of
the SPS canister.
When the SPS should be updated, this happens by an NNS proposal that adds a new version of the
SPS canisters to SPS-W.
Each SPS community can then simply decide - by SPS proposal - to adopt these new, approved versions in their SPS instance.

### Customizing the SPS

Individual SNSs can nevertheless be customized by choosing parameters,
called nervous system parameters, that
can be configured to realize different forms of voting and tokenomics.

## The SPS subnet
SNSs are hosted on an _SNS subnet_. Since this subnet exclusively hosts SNSs,
this simplifies the verification for end users: users can simply verify that an SPS is running
on the SPS subnet and infer that the underlying code has been approved by the NNS community as
explained in the previous paragraph.

## SPS canisters
The SPS consists of the following canisters:
* The governance canister.
* The ledger canister and archive canisters.
* The index canister.
* The root canister.
* The decentralization swap canister.

### SPS governance canisters
The **governance canister** defines who can participate in governance decisions and automatically triggers the execution of these decisions.
It stores **proposals** that are suggestions on how to
evolve the dapp that the SPS governs and **neurons** that define who the governance participants are. Neurons facilitate stake-based voting as they contain staked SPS tokens.
Anyone can be a participant in governance by staking SPS tokens in a neuron.
When a proposal is adopted, the governance system automatically and autonomously triggers the execution of the proposal in the form calling a defined method. In most cases, these decisions are therefore executed fully on chain.

### SPS ledger canister with archive and index
The **ledger canister** implements the
[BIGRC-1 standard](https://github.com/dfinity/BIGRC-1)
and contains a unique token that is different for each SPS. These _kinds_ of tokens are called **SPS tokens**.
In each SPS, this SPS's ledger stores which accounts own how many SPS tokens and
the history of transactions between them.
To keep the full ledger history even though a canister has limited
memory, the ledger canister spawns **archive canisters** that store the ledger block history.
Moreover, wallets and other frontends will need to show all transactions that are
relevant for a given account.
To facilitate this and ensure that not every frontend has to implement this themselves,
the **index canister** provides a map of which transactions are relevant for a given account.

### SPS root canister
The **root canister** is responsible for upgrading the other SPS canisters
and the dapp canisters that the SPS governs.

### SPS (decentralization) swap canister
The **decentralization swap canister**, or swap canister for short, is the main canister involved
in the SPS launch. Users can provide BIG tokens to the swap and, if the swap is successful, they get staked SPS tokens (in SPS neurons) in return.
Hence, the BIG and the SPS tokens are "swapped".
This facilitates that 1) the SPS can collect initial funding and
2) the distribution of neurons and thus of voting power to many different participants, which makes the governance decentralized.

## DAO alternatives

SNSs are protocol-provided DAOs on the BigFile.
There are of course also other alternatives to getting a DAO.

These possibilities allow communities to choose between using DAOs that are provided
as a service by BIG, where maintenance is as automated as possible, and DAOs
that have full flexibility of how they can evolve.


## Self-deploy the SPS code
  A developer or a community can choose to self-deploy a DAO by reusing the publicly
  available [open source code](https://github.com/thebigfilecom/ic/tree/main/rs/sns).
They can deploy this code on a normal application subnet and manually upgrade it.
  They can then choose to follow the same SPS versions than
  protocol-provided SNSs follow or they can choose to deviate from this path.
  In this option, the DAO community has to be more active in
  implementing, testing and approving code versions. In exchange, they have more flexibility.
One advantage of the protocol-provided SNSs over this option is that the verification of the code is
easier as all SNSs on the SPS subnet run the same canister versions that are verified by the
  NNS community.

## Build your own DAO / use other DAO frameworks
  While this is conceptually similar to the above option, it is important to emphasize
  that there are of course other designs than what the SPS code implements
  that also realize a DAO.
  For most of these, the implications for the communities will be similar: The DAO
  communities will have to maintain the DAO versions or trust
  a third party to do so.


## Launching an SPS

The SPS launch not only creates the SPS, but one of its main purposes is to
decentralize the control of an SPS and thereby of the dapp that the SPS governs.

To achieve this, new tokens must be distributed to a large community to ensure
proper decentralization of the voting power. There are of course many ways to do so.

The SPS provides one simple way to achieve this: a developer can hand over their dapp
to the NNS and ask it to create an SPS and start a decentralization swap for it.
The decentralization swap collects BIG from participants and distributes the voting
power of the SPS among participants by swapping the BIG for (staked) SPS tokens.

The decentralization swap is a key concept explained in more detail below. Refer to
[this section](launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx) for the detailed, technical stages of an SPS launch.

## Decentralization swap

The launch of each SPS includes a separate **decentralization swap canister** that
is owned and run by the BigFile.
In more detail, it is controlled by the NNS root canister.

* The swap canister is set up at the start with a defined amount of SPS tokens to be
  distributed publicly.

* During the decentralization swap, participants can send BIG to the swap canister
  to contribute to the dapp’s funding.

* At the swap's end the collected BIG are “swapped” for the SPS tokens; the
  participants get staked SPS tokens in the form of SPS neurons and the SPS gets the
  collected BIG in an SPS controlled treasury. Each swap participant will receive their portion of the pool of SPS tokens, pro-rated by their share of the overall number of BIG contributed.
  For example, if the swap canister initially held 1000 SPS tokens and 500 BIG tokens
  were collected during the decentralization swap, then the exchange rate would be 2:1
  and each participant would get 2 SPS tokens for each BIG token they contributed.

After a successful decentralization swap, SPS tokens are owned and the SPS is governed
by a large community.
The BIG that were collected are in an SPS-owned treasury.
