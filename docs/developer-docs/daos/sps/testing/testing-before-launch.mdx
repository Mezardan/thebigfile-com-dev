# SPS testing before launch

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Governance", "Concept"]} />


Before SPS creation, it is advisable to thoroughly test the process.

## Two main ways for testing an SPS decentralization

### On a local machine

Developers can **[test on a local machine](./testing-locally.mdx)**. The [sns-testing repository](https://github.com/dfinity/sns-testing) contains scripts that help developers test the SPS creation process. They can deploy the dapp in a local canister development environment and run through [the stages of decentralizing their dapp](../launching/launch-summary-1proposal.mdx).

**The main intent of `sns-testing` repo is for a developer to test the actual process of decentralizing their dapp.**

Among other things, developers can use `sns-testing` repo to:
* Initiate proposals.
* Pass proposals.
* Start decentralization swaps.
* Upgrade the dapp via DAO voting.

:::info
`sns-testing` is just one form of testing SPS process locally. Developers should feel free to use others, fork/modify `sns-testing` or create their own.

### On the mainnet

Once a developer has tested the process of an SPS, it is highly recommended they do [an **"SPS testflight" on mainnet**](./testing-on-mainnet.mdx). An SPS testflight is when a developer deploys their dapp (to mainnet) and hands control of it to a mock SPS (on mainnet).

**The main intent of performing an SPS testflight is for developers to experience how a dapp works *after* it has been decentralized, so developers can make sure their dapp is ready for decentralization. It does not test the actual process of decentralizing it.**

:::info
A testflight is not a repository or a set of tools, but an *activity* (deploying and dapp and handing control of it to a mock SPS), so the [instructions for testing on mainnet](./testing-on-mainnet.mdx) utilize various tools, but developers can of course use any tools they wish.
:::

Among other things, here are some examples of issues developers find when running an SPS testflight:
* They need a better pipeline for creating proposals to update a dapp.
* They may have decentralized prematurely and need to fix some things.
* They may need better monitoring before decentralizing.

The mock SPS used in a SPS testflight gives developers the ability to see how post-decentralization lifecycle of a dapp looks like, but still provides a way for a developer to keep control of their dapp. **Therefore, developers are encouraged to run and perform an SPS testflight on mainnet, potentially for multiple days or weeks, to ensure that all aspects have been covered.**
