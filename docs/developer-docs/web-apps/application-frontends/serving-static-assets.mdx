# Serving static assets

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

## Types of assets

Assets can come in many forms, such as:

- CSS.

- JavaScript.

- React.

- HTML.

- Images, videos, or streaming content.

- User interfaces that combine CSS, HTML, React, or other frameworks together.

- Dynamic assets, such as dashboards that frequently update with real-time data. 

- Point of sale interfaces.

This guide will focus on static assets using HTML and CSS. For more information on using other asset types, follow the [custom frontend](custom-frontend.mdx) guide or the [existing frontend](existing-frontend.mdx) guide.

## Creating a static `index.html` page

In your project's asset subdirectory, create an `index.html` file that contains some HTML code, such as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<title>Static BigFile webpage</title> 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="description" content="This is a static webpage hosted on BIG using a frontend canister."> 
</head> 
<body> 
<h1>Welcome to my BigFile-hosted webpage</h1> 
<p>This showcases how static assets can be hosted within an BIG Smart Contract.</p>
<img src="testpic.jpg" alt="This is a test image" height="420" width="420">
<table> 
<tr> 
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td> 
<td>Row 1 - Column 2 </td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td> 
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td> 
</tr> 
</table> 
</body> 
</html>
```

This snippet uses an image, `testpic.jpg`. You can replace this with any image asset stored in your asset subdirectory.

### Styling the page with CSS 

To make customize the visualization of HTML webpages, you can use CSS by editing your `index.html` file to include a style definition:

```html
<style> 
    #nav { 
        background: lightpurple; 
        overflow: auto; 
        } 
    #nav li { 
        float: left; 
        padding: 10px; 
        } 
    #nav li:hover { 
        background: gray;
        } 
</style> 
<ul id="nav"> 
<li><a href="">Home</a></li> 
<li><a href="">Shop</a></li> 
<li><a href="">About Us</a></li> 
<li><a href="">Contact Us</a></li> 
</ul>

```

## Deploy your webpage

Once your static website is ready to deploy, you can deploy it to the mainnet with the `Mainnet` command.

:::caution 

Deploying to the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).

Once deployed, your webpage will be served at a URL such as:


## Next steps 

Here are some tutorials with example code for developing a frontend further:

- [Customize the frontend](./custom-frontend.mdx): a tutorial on building a React dapp.

- Using [React and compiled JavaScript](./custom-frontend.mdx) to embed HTML attributes and elements directly in a page.

- Using [React and TypeScript](./add-stylesheet.mdx) to import CSS properties from an external file.

- Deploying an [existing React application](./existing-frontend.mdx) as a frontend canister.
