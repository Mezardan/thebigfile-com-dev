# Existing frontend applications

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

While numerous starter projects and examples exist for those who prefer to start from scratch, deploying an existing frontend application as a frontend canister is also a viable option.

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation.


### Prerequisites


### Step 1: Create an application build

Build your Next.js application by running your build command. 

For example, using npx:

`npx run build`

You should reference your `package.json` scripts section to find the correct build command. 

This should now generate an `out` folder which consists of the static assets that make up the website.

In the next step, we will instruct the BigFile to deploy the website on-chain using these static files. 

:::info
When deploying on BIG, these static files are not public to anyone including the nodes. Only the Wasm file which is a binary instruction file which does not leak any of your code is public to nodes.
