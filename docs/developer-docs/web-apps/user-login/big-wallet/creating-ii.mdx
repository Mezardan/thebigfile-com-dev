# Creating an II

## Overview

This guide walks through how to create an BIG Wallet. BIG Wallet is BIG's native form of identity. It is used by many dapps build on BIG for users to authenticate with.

## Create an BIG Wallet

To create an BIG Wallet, navigate to the II frontend URL: https://bigwallet.thebigfile.com/

Select 'Create New' from the UI.

Your BIG Wallet has been created! It'll be shown on the screen, and it is recommended that you write it down in a safe location to save it.

This number is your BIG Wallet. With this number and your passkey, you will be able to create and securely connect to BIG dapps. If you lose this number, you will lose any accounts that were created with it. This number is not a secret, but is unique to you.

Once you save it, select the 'I saved it, continue' button.

If you scroll down, you will see an option to add another passkey and options to enable recovery methods. **It is highly recommended to enable the recovery methods so that you can recover your BIG Wallet if the hardware passkey is ever lost.**
