# Considerations for NFT developers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "NFTs", "Concept"]} />



## Overview

An NFT or **non-fungible token** is a record on a blockchain that is associated with a particular digital or physical asset. The unique digital representation on a blockchain allows the proving of ownership as well as their trading.

## NFTs on the BigFile

The BigFile Protocol brings a lot of potential for NFTs.

### NFT asset storage for cross-chain NFTs

NFT assets, including images, sound clips, or videos, can be securely stored on-chain entirely on BIG, even while the NFT itself is minted on various chains, such as on any EVM chain.

### Generative NFTs

Dynamic NFTs can be curated to evolve based on both data stored on BIG or external APIs.

### Minting NFTs on BIG

For developers seeking to store assets and mint NFTs directly on the BigFile (BIG), an NFT implementation typically encompasses three core functionalities:

- A registry to monitor ownership and facilitate transfers.
- A ledger or transaction history.
- The actual asset itself (in the case of digital assets).

#### NFT interface specifications and implementations

Refer to the [creating NFTs on BIG](/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-5/5.3-NFT-tutorial#icrc-7) tutorial for more information.
