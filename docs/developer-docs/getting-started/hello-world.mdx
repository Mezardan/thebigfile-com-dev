This guide shows how to get started developing on BigFile quickly by deploying your first 'Hello, world!' smart contract.

## Choosing a developer environment 

To deploy a simple 'Hello, world!' smart contract, you can use a variety of developer environments, such as:

- Native installation of tools on Linux, Mac, or Windows (using WSL) systems.

- Cloud-based environments such as Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces.


:::info

**Which environment should you choose?**

Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces are cloud-based developer environments that can be accessed via a web browser. The Gitpod and GitHub Codespace examples linked on this page come with the necessary tools and dependencies pre-installed. These environments use limited cloud resources and may not scale well for building large, complex projects.
