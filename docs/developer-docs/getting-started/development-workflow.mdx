## Development environments

There are several different environments that can be used to write, deploy, and test smart contracts. Each environment has different characteristics and benefits.

- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install): 

- [Gitpod](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod):

- [GitHub Codespaces](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/codespaces):

**Differences between Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces**

[**Gitpod**](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod):
- Open-source.
- Choose a repository to deploy into the Gitpod. Must pick an existing repo.
- Choose from several different IDEs to be used in the workspace (VSCode, Terminal, PyCharm, etc).
- Supports snapshots.
- GitLab and Bitbucket integrations.

[**GitHub Codespaces**](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/codespaces):
- Proprietary GitHub software.
- Do not need to select an existing repo to deploy into the Codespace. You can choose between several different template development environments that come with pre-installed dependencies, or choose an existing repo.
- Cannot choose between different IDEs to be used in the Codespace.
- Cannot choose between different workspace resources.
- Does not support snapshots.
- Does not integrate with GitLab or Bitbucket.
