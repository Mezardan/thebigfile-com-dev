## Overview

Cubes contain both code and state. Once you have written the code for a <GlossaryTooltip>cube</GlossaryTooltip>, the cube doesn't exist until it is registered with BigFile, either locally or the mainnet.

A cube can be created without first compiling any code. When cubes are created with [`dfx canister create`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create), they are empty and do not contain program code. The code must be compiled into Wasm and installed into the empty cube before it can be deployed.

## Creating cubes 

When a cube is created, either locally or on the mainnet, the following steps happen:

- The cube ID is registered with the local replica or the mainnet for each cube in the project's `dfx.json` file.

- The following cube components are created:
      - List of controllers.
      - Cycles balance.
      - Reserved cycles balance.
      - Cube status.
      - Resource reservations.

- The cube's ID is returned in the command line.

To create a cube locally, the `dfx canister create` command can be used:

```
dfx canister create hello_world // Create a cube locally
dfx canister create hello_world --network ic // Create a cube on the mainnet
dfx canister create --all --network ic // Create all cubes in the project's dfx.json file
```

:::caution 
Creating a cube on the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet)
:::

At this step, settings can be configured for the cube using the optional flags. [View the full list of settings that can be configured](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#options-1).

Once your cube has been created, it is ready to be compiled.
