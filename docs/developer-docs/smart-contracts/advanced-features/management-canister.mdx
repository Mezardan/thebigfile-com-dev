# BIG management canister

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Concept"]} />

## Overview

The BIG management canister is used to provide access to system features, such as managing canisters, integrating with Bitcoin, making HTTPS outcalls, signing with threshold ECDSA, and securely retrieving randomness.


The management canister is a virtual canister in the sense that it does not exist with an isolated state or Wasm module, but rather is implemented as part of BIG itself. For most practical purposes, the management canister behaves like a canister, i.e. it can accept messages from users or other canisters and can respond to those messages just like any other canister.


The address of the BIG management canister is `aaaaa-aa` (i.e. the empty blob). It is present on any BIG subnet. By using this address, a canister can access the management canister either on the local or remote subnet -- BIG will take care of routing the request to the appropriate subnet transparently. The cost of making the call is charged to the calling canister just like any other inter-canister call.

:::note

Certain functionalities, such as threshold signing or access to the bitcoin APIs, are only enabled on certain subnets.

:::

The management canister can also be called by users. Most methods are only permitted to be called by the [controllers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/control/) of the canister. Certain calls can only be made by a canister and are not available for users (e.g. `raw_rand` or `deposit_cycles`). When a user makes a call to the management canister, the cost of processing the request is charged to the canister that is being managed.




## Why does the management canister exist?


Providing this functionality through a virtual canister, i.e. the management canister, allows for BIG to reuse a lot of the mechanics that are already available and provides a familiar approach to users and canisters to access this API through inter-canister calls.

## How can you interact with the management canister?

Since the management canister behaves like a canister, users or other canisters can call its provided interfaces like any other canister on BIG.

Here are some examples calling the management canister:

<AdornedTabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="motoko" label="Motoko" default>

```motoko
actor {
  let ic = actor "aaaaa-aa" : BIG.Self;
  public func startCanister(canisterId: Principal) : async () {
	await ic.start_canister({canister_id = canisterId});
  };
};
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

```rust
#[ic_cdk_macros::update]
async fn install_code(canister_id: CanisterId, wasm_module: Vec<u8>) {
    use ic_cdk::api::management_canister::{
        install_code, CanisterInstallMode, InstallCodeArgumentExtended
    };

    let arg = InstallCodeArgumentExtended {
        mode: CanisterInstallMode::Install,
        canister_id,
        wasm_module,
        arg: vec![],
        sender_canister_version: None,
    };
    install_code(arg).await;
}
```
</TabItem>

<AdornedTab value={"typescript"} label="TypeScript" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

```typescript
createCanister: update([], CreateCanisterResult, async () => {
  return await ic.call(managementCanister.create_canister, {
    args: [{ settings: None, sender_canister_version: None }],
    cycles: 50_000_000_000_000n
  });
})
```

</AdornedTab>

<AdornedTab value={"python"} label="Python" endAdornment={<BetaChip />}>

```python
@update
def get_raw_rand() -> Async[RawRandResult]:
    raw_rand_call_result: CallResult[blob] = yield management_canister.raw_rand()

    return match(
        raw_rand_call_result,
        {
            "Ok": lambda randomness: {"Ok": randomness},
            "Err": lambda err: {"Err": err},
        },
    )
```

## Typical workflows involving the management canister

The management canister offers a variety of endpoints that provide access to special features available on BIG. These can be grouped into a few main areas. Let's explore some of those.

### Managing canisters

The most commonly used APIs of the management canister are those that are related to managing canisters. These include operations like creating or installing canisters, changing their settings or uninstalling and deleting canisters. These operations are typically only permitted to be called by controllers of the canister.

### Signing and submitting Bitcoin transactions

### HTTPS outcalls


### Retrieving randomness
