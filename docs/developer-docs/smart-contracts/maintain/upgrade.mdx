# Upgrade

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Unlike a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> reinstall that preserves the canister identifier but no state, a canister upgrade enables you to preserve the state of a deployed canister, and change the code.

For example, assume you have a dapp that manages professional profiles and social connections. If you want to add a new feature to the dapp, you need to be able to update the canister code without losing any of the previously-stored data. A canister upgrade enables you to update existing canister identifiers with program changes without losing the program state.


To upgrade a canister:

- #### Step 1:  Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory.

- #### Step 2:  Start the local canister execution environment, if necessary.

    In most cases, this step is only necessary if you are running the canisters locally.

    If you were registering canisters to run on a remote execution environment, e.g. BIG blockchain, you would include the `--network` command-line option to perform tasks on the environment specified under this parameter.

- #### Step 3:  Verify you have canister identifiers for all of the canisters you want to upgrade.

    Note that your program must identify the variables for which to maintain state by using the `stable` keyword in the variable declaration.

    

- #### Step 4:  Upgrade all of the canisters by running the following command:

        dfx canister install --all --mode upgrade
