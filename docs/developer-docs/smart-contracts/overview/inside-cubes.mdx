# Inside cubes

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Concept"]} />

Cubes are WebAssembly (Wasm) programs with additional features that allow them to store persistent data, communicate with users and other cubes, and be managed by entities such as DAOs.
To enable these functionalities, cubes have additional components alongside the the standard Wasm code and memory. These components are outlined in the diagram below.


## Cube ID
A cube has a unique identifier that is often referred to as the address of the cube or the <GlossaryTooltip>principal</GlossaryTooltip> of the cube.
When a user or a cube sends a message to another cube, they specify the target cube by its id in the header of the message.
The system then routes the message to the target cube and adds it to the input queue of that cube.

## Input queue
Cubes have queues for incoming messages.
When a cube is scheduled for execution, it takes one message from the queue and runs the corresponding Wasm function specified by that message.
The code of the function is stored in the Wasm binary of the cube.
During execution, the function reads the payload of the message and modifies data stored in the cube.

:::info
The order of messages in the queue depends on the implementation and it is not necessarily FIFO (first-in first-out).
:::


Both the Wasm and stable memories are persistent in the sense that the system automatically commits all memory modifications after a successful execution of a message.
If the message execution fails, then the changes are not committed.
The difference between the Wasm and the stable memory becomes important during cube upgrades to a new Wasm code.
A cube upgrade clears the Wasm memory, but preserves the stable memory (hence the name).

## Output queue
During execution, the cube may send messages to other cubes.
These messages are enqueued in the output queue of the cube after a successful execution.
Later on, BigFile delivers these messages to the target cubes for processing.

:::info
Cube-to-cube calls are implemented on top of messages. Each call consists of two messages: the call message from the caller to callee and the response message from the callee to the caller.
:::

## Cycles balance
Cubes pay for execution in [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).
The cost of execution depends on the number and type of executed Wasm instructions.
The system charges this cost from the cycles balance of the cube both for successful and failed executions.

## Controllers
Only [controllers](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/maintain/control) of the cube can do certain system level operations on the cube such as stopping it, starting it, upgrading it, etc.
The list of controller principals is stored in the cube.
Both users and cubes can be controllers.
If the cube has no controllers, then it is immutable in the sense that its Wasm code cannot be changed.

## Settings
A cube also has various other settings and flags that can be modified by controllers of the cube.
For example, a controller can set the freezing threshold of the canister such that the cube becomes frozen and doesn't execute messages when it is low on cycles in order to reduce chances of running out of cycles.
