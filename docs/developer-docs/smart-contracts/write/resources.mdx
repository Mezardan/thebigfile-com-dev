## Overview

After learning about the different [workflows](./overview.mdx) that can be followed when creating a <Tooltip text="A smart contract on BIG.">cube</Tooltip>, the [languages](./overview.mdx#choosing-the-programming-language-for-the-backend) that can be used, and the components that go into a cube, its time to write the cube code.

To write cube code, several different tools can be used.

## Cube development kits (CDKs)

A cube development kit (CDK) provides programming languages with the necessary features and functionality to create, deploy, and manage cubes. CDKs are a popular choice for developers who prefer a standard development workflow.

To develop using a CDK, see the documentation for the CDK of your choice below.

BigFile maintained CDKs include:

- [Motoko](/docs/current/motoko/main/getting-started/motoko-introduction).

- [Rust](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust)

Community contributed and maintained CDKs include:

- [Kybra: Python CDK - Beta](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/python).

- [Azle: TypeScript CDK - Beta](/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/typescript).

- [C++ CDK](https://docs.icpp.world/).

## Integrated development environments (IDEs)

Another popular tool used in standard development workflows are integrated development environments (IDEs). IDEs are commonly used in conjunction with CDKs to create, edit, and manage code files. Any IDE can be used to create and edit canister code. Some examples with documentation include:

- [Visual Studio Code](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/vs-code).

- [Gitpod](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/gitpod).

- [Motoko playground](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/ide/playground).

## Frameworks

As an alternative approach to the standard development workflow, a framework-based approach can be used. Frameworks offer additional services, such handling the cube deployment and data hosting for you. Currently supported frameworks include:

- [Juno](docs/current/developer-docs/web-apps/frameworks/juno).

- [BIG BVM](docs/current/developer-docs/backend/solidity).
