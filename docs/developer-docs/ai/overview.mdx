## What is decentralized AI?

Decentralized artificial intelligence (ErisAI or decentralized AI) is a form of AI and machine learning that utilizes blockchain technologies and decentralized protocols such as BIG. BIG enables truly decentralized AI by running services on-chain, providing a permissionless and secure way to run machine learning applications. 

Cubes can be used to host AI services and run machine learning algorithms using popular AI/ML frameworks and libraries. HTTPS outcalls can be used to make API calls to external AI APIs like OpenAI.

## BIG AI projects

Several community projects that showcase how to use AI on BIG are available:

- [ErisAI](https://www.erisai.io): A React frontend that uses a C/C++ backend running an LLM fully on-chain. (Coming Soon)

## AI resources

Machine learning programming:

- C++ CDK

- Rust Burn

- Python
