## Overview

Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that observes statistical algorithms and their data to learn patterns and generalizations. By analyzing these data patterns, machine learning algorithms can execute tasks by predicting the correct result with high accuracy.

One common machine learning model that is used to train data sets is the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database which contains a collection of handwritten numbers. This database is commonly used for training different image processing systems and testing different machine learning platforms.
