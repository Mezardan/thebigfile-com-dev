# Asset canisters

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

## Overview

An [asset canister](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister), also referred to as a 'frontend canister' is a type of canister deployed on ICP that can be used to store and retrieve an application's frontend, typically used to serve static HTML, JS, and CSS assets.

To serve web content, a canister must implement a method that consumes an HTTP request (url, http method, and headers) and outputs an HTTP response (status, headers, and body). The canister method could return assets in the form of HTML, CSS, and Javascript content as part of the HTTP response.

A canister configured as `"type": "asset"` already contains the boilerplate code to facilitate these HTTP requests, making serving static content simple. Once the asset canister is deployed on ICP, the frontend interface can be accessed at `http://<canister id>.icp0.io` and `http://<canister id>.raw.icp0.io`.

## Default settings

An asset canister can be configured in your project's `dfx.json` file by specifying the canister's `type` as `asset`:

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "www": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "assets/src/index.html"
      },
      "source": [
        "assets/assets",
        "assets/src"
      ],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "args": "",
      "packtool": ""
    }
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

By default, all projects created with `dfx new` have the option to include an asset canister in the project. If an asset canister is created through `dfx`, the default configuration includes a Rust canister that uses one of the following frontend frameworks: SvelteKit, React, Vue or Vanilla JS. The user can choose the framework through the `dfx new` interactive prompt.

For asset canisters created by `dfx new`, the default configuration will include:

- `"entrypoint": "assets/src/index.html"`: The webpage that should be served by default. If an asset cannot be found, this `index.html` page is served as the default fallback.

- `"source": [ "assets/assets", "assets/src"]`: The default subdirectories containing asset files. For assets to be served in the asset canister, their directories must be included in this `source` list.

- `"type": "assets"`: Defines the canister type as `assets`.

:::caution
The asset canister can host roughly 1GB in static files. It is recommended that you distribute your files
across multiple canisters if the total size of all your assets begins to exceed this amount. Once you exceed this
figure, your canister may fail to upgrade.

## Rust crate

The [`ic-asset`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-asset) Rust crate can be used to develop your project's asset canister.

Additionally, the [ic-http-certification](https://crates.io/crates/ic-http-certification) crate can be used to:

- Serve certified assets from the same canister as their primary “backend” canister.

- Embed assets directly into a canister’s Wasm rather than uploading them at runtime.

- Create custom routing logic, such as:
    - Serving 404 pages in multi-page apps.
    - Serving multiple frontends from the same canister.
    - Certify more complex caching or streaming scenarios.

## Third-party options for serving assets

Other third-party options for serving assets include:

- [`ic-pluto`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-pluto)

- [Motoko server](https://mops.one/server)

- [Certified HTTP](https://mops.one/certified-http)

- Express (via [Azle](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/))

## Customizing the configuration

You can configure how the asset canister responds to requests for specific assets by defining your
desired configuration in a file named `.ic-assets.json` Each entry in `.ic-assets.json` allows for specifying a glob pattern along with the headers to be returned in the response for any file that matches the pattern. You may also dictate whether redirects are performed from the non-certified endpoint to a certified endpoint for any given filename pattern.

Here is a sample:

```json
[
    {
        "match": "**/*",
        "headers": {
            // Security: The Content Security Policy (CSP) given below aims at working with many apps rather than providing maximal security.
            // We recommend tightening the CSP for your specific application. Some recommendations are as follows:
            // - Use the CSP Evaluator (https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/) to validate the CSP you define.
            // - Follow the “Strict CSP” recommendations (https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html). However, note that in the context of the IC,
            //   nonces cannot be used because the response bodies must be static to work well with HTTP asset certification.
            //   Thus, we recommend to include script hashes (in combination with strict-dynamic) in the CSP as described
            //   in https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/faq.html in section “What if my site is static and I can't add nonces to scripts?”.
            //   See for example the II CSP (https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/main/src/internet_identity/src/http.rs).
            // - It is recommended to tighten the connect-src directive. With the current CSP configuration the browser can
            //   make requests to https://*.icp0.io, hence being able to call any canister via https://icp0.io/api/v2/canister/{canister-ID}.
            //   This could potentially be used in combination with another vulnerability (e.g. XSS) to exfiltrate private data.
            //   The developer can configure this policy to only allow requests to their specific canisters,
            //   e.g: connect-src 'self' https://icp-api.io/api/v2/canister/{my-canister-ID}, where {my-canister-ID} has the following format: aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaa
            // - It is recommended to configure style-src, style-src-elem and font-src directives with the resources your canister is going to use
            //   instead of using the wild card (*) option. Normally this will include 'self' but also other third party styles or fonts resources (e.g: https://fonts.googleapis.com or other CDNs)

            // Notes about the CSP below:
            // - script-src 'unsafe-eval' is currently required because agent-js uses a WebAssembly module for the validation of bls signatures.
            //   There is currently no other way to allow execution of WebAssembly modules with CSP.
            //   See: https://github.com/WebAssembly/content-security-policy/blob/main/proposals/CSP.md.
            // - We added img-src data: because data: images are used often.
            // - frame-ancestors: none mitigates clickjacking attacks. See https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking.
            "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self';script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline';connect-src 'self' http://localhost:* https://icp0.io https://*.icp0.io https://icp-api.io;img-src 'self' data:;style-src * 'unsafe-inline';style-src-elem * 'unsafe-inline';font-src *;object-src 'none';base-uri 'self';frame-ancestors 'none';form-action 'self';upgrade-insecure-requests;",

        },
        // Uncomment to redirect all requests from .raw.icp0.io to .icp0.io
        // "allow_raw_access": false
    },
]
```

## Dynamic URLs

Dynamic URLs are currently not supported by the default asset canister.

If a developer would like to support dynamic URLs, custom logic can be implemented using [third-party options for serving assets](#third-party-options-for-serving-assets).

## 404 pages and aliasing

You can use the `ic-http-certification` crate for serving 404 pages or configuring redirects through the crate's wildcard function such as:

```rust
use ic_http_certification::HttpCertificationPath;

let path = HttpCertificationPath::wildcard("/js");
```

404 pages can only be served as raw content currently.

```go
#[update]
async fn authorize(other: Principal)

#[update]
async fn grant_permission(arg: GrantPermissionArguments)

#[update]
async fn validate_grant_permission(arg: GrantPermissionArguments) -> Result<String, String>

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common resolutions for issues encountered with the asset canister.

### Asset canister fails to upgrade

It is likely that the total size of all the static files stored in your asset canister exceed the
recommended 1GB limit. The resolution is to uninstall and redeploy your canister code.

```bash
dfx canister uninstall-code <CANISTER NAME or ID>
```

```bash
dfx deploy --upgrade-unchanged <CANISTER NAME>
```

:::caution
This will incur downtime. This first uninstalls the Wasm module from your canister. During this period, your canister
will not be reachable. The second command redeploys with fresh state, after which point, your canister will be available
to serve assets again.
