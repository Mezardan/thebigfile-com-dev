# Supported signatures

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

## Currently supported signatures

BIG currently supports the following cryptographic signature types:

- [ECDSA](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/t-ecdsa): ECDSA is supported via the BIG's novel threshold ECDSA protocol. Threshold ECDSA uses private ECDSA keys that only exist as secret shares that are distributed across the nodes within the threshold ECDSA subnet. Signatures are generated by leveraging these secret shares without reconstructing the subnet secret key. [Learn more about t-ECDSA](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/encryption/t-ecdsa)


## Future additions

The following signatures are planned to be supported in the future:

- Schnorr

- EdDSA

- Multi-signature

- Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs)

- Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs)

- Proof of Logical Obliviousness (PLONK)
