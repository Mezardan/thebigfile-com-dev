## Overview
A list of possible errors returned when executing canisters.

## Errors

### Method not found
A canister was called with a method name not exported by that canister.

An example of this error is:
```
  Error from Canister xxx-xxx: Canister has no update method 'foobar'.
```

To fix this error, consider:

- Checking that the method name exactly matches the name exported by the callee.
- Checking that the method type (update, query, etc...) is the same as the type of the exported method.
- The canister code of the callee has not been modified to a version that deprecates the method.

For further information on calling canisters see the [smart contract docs](../developer-docs/smart-contracts/call/overview) and the [IC spec](./ic-interface-spec#system-api-requests).
