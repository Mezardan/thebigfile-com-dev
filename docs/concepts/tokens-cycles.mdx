# BIG tokens

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Concept"]} />

## Overview 
Engage with the BigFile and its ecosystem through the use of its native utility token.

## BIG Token plays multiple essential roles within the BigFile ecosystem:

Permanent Data Storage: Users pay with BIG Token to store their data permanently on the BigFile network. The "pay once, store forever" model ensures that, once the storage fee is paid, the data remains permanently stored on the network.

Versioning: When users want to add new versions to the data they have permanently uploaded, they make payments using BIG Token.

Network Participation and Incentives: Miners earn BIG Token by contributing storage capacity and ensuring the network operates smoothly. This incentive mechanism helps maintain the security and sustainability of the network.

Ecosystem Development: dApps and projects running on BigFile pay transaction fees using BIG Token. Project owners and developers leverage BIG Token to run their applications, raise funds, and support the growth of the ecosystem.
