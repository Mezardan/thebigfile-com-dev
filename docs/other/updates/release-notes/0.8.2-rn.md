# Highlights of whatâ€™s new in 0.8.2

An overview of the 0.8.2 release:

-   Breaking change in how to specify a controller to `dfx canister create`

-   Be sure to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

## Changes to DFX

### Breaking change: controller parameter for dfx canister create

Breaking change: The controller parameter for `dfx canister create` is now passed as a named parameter, rather than optionally following the canister name.

Old: dfx canister create \[canister name\] \[controller\] New: dfx canister create --controller \<controller\> \[canister name\]

### JS Codegen update - JSDoc comment now accepts a complete Agent for createActor

### dfx canister delete can now return cycles to a wallet or dank

By default `dfx canister delete` will return cycles to the default cycles wallet. Cycles can be returned to a designated canister with `--withdraw-cycles-to-canister` and cycles can be returned to dank at the current identity principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank` and to a designated principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank-principal`.

### New feature: dfx canister create now accepts multiple instances of --controller argument

It is now possible to create canisters with more than one controller by passing multiple instances of the `--controller` parameter to `dfx canister create`.

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

### New feature: dfx canister update-settings now accepts multiple instance of --controller argument

It is now possible to configure a canister to have more than one controller by passing multiple instances of the `--controller` parameter to `dfx canister update-settings`.

### New feature: dfx canister info and dfx canister status now display all controllers

### Fixed: dfx now respects $DFX_CONFIG_ROOT when looking for legacy credentials

Previously this would always look in `$HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem`.

### Fixed: changed dfx canister (create\|update-settings) --memory-allocation limit to 12 GiB

Updated the maximum value for the `--memory-allocation` value to be 12 GiB (12,884,901,888 bytes)

## Changes to Cycles Wallet


### Added support for multiple controllers

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`
